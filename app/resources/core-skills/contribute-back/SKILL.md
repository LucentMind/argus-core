description: Use when an investigation produced a reusable lesson worth adding to Argus's skills or references — a repeatable analysis procedure, a glossary/runbook correction, or a proven command recipe. Drafts an inert proposal the user reviews on the Skills page; never applies changes directly.

# Contribute Back

Turn what this case taught you into a proposal that improves Argus for every future case.
Proposals are **inert files** — nothing changes until the user accepts them on the Skills
page (Proposals tab). Your job ends when the proposal is drafted.

## When to propose

After an RCA or investigation surfaces something reusable:

| You found | Proposal type | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A repeatable analysis procedure no skill covers | `skill-new` | new skill dir name (kebab-case) |
| An improvement to an existing skill (missing step, wrong assumption, better tool use) | `skill-edit` | that skill's dir name |
| A correction or addition to a reference (glossary, runbook, protocol doc) | `reference-edit` | the reference file name |
| A proven command sequence worth keeping verbatim | `recipe` | short kebab-case name |

**Memory vs proposal vs case:** there are three destinations for what a case teaches you,
never two. Agent memory (`write_memory`) is **PERSONAL** — this user's standing preferences,
this machine's setup, or a correction of something you got wrong (scope: preference |
environment | correction). It is never for knowledge a teammate would also want, no matter
how durable or reusable the fact is: that is **team-valuable**, and it goes in the table
above as `reference-edit` (which CREATES the reference if the target doesn't exist yet) or
one of the other proposal types. Detail that only matters for this case is neither memory nor
a proposal — that's `append_finding`. So: true only for this user and machine → `write_memory`;
true for the whole team → a proposal (this page); true only for this case → `append_finding`.

## How to propose

1. **Read the current state first.** For `skill-edit` / `reference-edit`, read the existing
   SKILL.md or reference file in your session's skills/references — the tier winner there is
   exactly what the review UI diffs against. A proposal that duplicates or regresses current
   content wastes the user's review time.
2. **Generalize.** Strip case-specific details — no customer names, ticket numbers, secrets,
   or paths from this case. The proposal must make sense in a future, unrelated case.
3. **Call `mcp__argus__write_proposal`** with:
   - `type` — one of the four types above;
   - `target` — skill dir name or reference file name (see table);
   - `title` — one line the user can judge from the Proposals list without opening it;
   - `content` — the **full proposed file content** (frontmatter included for skills),
     never a diff or a fragment.
4. **One proposal per improvement.** Two unrelated lessons = two proposals.

## Boundaries

- NEVER edit `skills/` or `references/` through filesystem tools — proposals are the only
  path, and they are inert until the user accepts them.
- Do not re-draft a proposal the user already rejected in this session.
- After drafting, tell the user what you proposed and why, in one or two lines.

## Sweep before you draft

Before drafting a proposal, check whether the pattern is genuinely reusable: run one
`run_tool_script` sweep over case history and evidence (e.g. search_case_history +
search_evidence for the error signature) and cite the result in the proposal ("seen in
2 prior cases: X, Y" or "no prior occurrence found"). Keep write_proposal itself a
direct tool call — one call per proposal, never from inside a script.
