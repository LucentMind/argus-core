# Dev scripts

## seed-test-home.mjs

Seeds one `ARGUS_HOME` covering every surface of the app: five cases (four bound to real
`JiaweiHan88/HiveMindTest` pull requests, one fabricated), findings across every severity, layer,
review state and status-badge combination, evidence and review-artifact trees, proposals in every
type and reject-reason tag, skills and references across every tier, distill jobs and case
summaries.

```bash
ARGUS_HOME=/path/to/home npm run dev                                    # boot once so migrations run, then quit
ARGUS_HOME=/path/to/home node --experimental-sqlite scripts/seed-test-home.mjs
ARGUS_HOME=/path/to/home npm run dev                                    # boot again, click Rescan once per case IN EACH MODE
```

`scanEvidence` is per mode — it only scans `modeDir(argusHome, slug, mode)` and reconciles that
mode's rows, and the Rescan button passes whichever mode is currently active. Every seeded case
starts in `review` mode, so clicking Rescan once (as the plain phrase above might suggest) only
ingests `artifacts/`. To also ingest the `evidence/` tree, switch the case to `investigation` mode,
click Rescan, then switch back to `review` and click Rescan again. Skipping the investigation-mode
pass leaves the entire `evidence/` tree uningested — it never enters the database at all.

Requires `git` and `gh` on `PATH`, with `gh` **authenticated** for the target repository — the
script's preflight runs `gh auth status`, not just a presence check, so a `gh` that is installed
but logged out is still rejected before anything is written.

### Safety guard

The script refuses to run destructively against a home it does not own:

- It refuses the app's default home (`~/Argus`) outright, under any flag, including `--force`.
- Against any other home, it refuses to run if that home holds content it did not author
  (existing `references/`, `skills-user/`, `skills-hivemind/`, `memory/` or `proposals/`) unless
  you pass `--force`.
- On a successful run it writes a `.argus-seed-home` marker into the home. A home carrying that
  marker needs no `--force` to re-seed — the marker is proof a prior run of this same script
  owns it.
- `config/hivemind-state.json`, `config/settings.json`, `config/agent-access.json` and
  `config/tool-risk.json` are overwritten wholesale on every run (they are deliberately excluded
  from the marker/guard check above — a freshly booted home always has a fully-configured
  `config/` even before it has ever been seeded, so guarding it there would make every first seed
  of a scratch home demand `--force`). Each file's contents from just before the _first_ such
  overwrite are backed up to `config/.seed-backup/<name>.json`. That backup is first-generation
  wins: once a backup for a name exists, a later run never replaces it, so it stays whatever
  predated the seed rather than turning into a copy of the seed's own output.

### Evidence is not pre-seeded

**Evidence rows do not exist until you click Rescan.** The seed writes the `evidence/` and
`artifacts/` trees to disk as plain files and leaves the app's own `scanEvidence` (via the
Rescan action) to ingest them into the database. This is deliberate: a fixture that
reimplemented `indexer.ts`'s chunking would drift out of sync with the real implementation over
time and start lying about how evidence search actually behaves.

### Re-running

Idempotent: per-case destructive, globally additive for anything outside the seed's own scope.
Each of the five seeded slugs' cases (sessions, turns, tool calls, findings, PR bindings,
evidence/artifacts trees, worktrees, `distill_jobs` and `case_summaries` rows) is deleted and
rebuilt from scratch — scoped to the five roster slugs, never a blanket wipe of those two tables.
Separately, the knowledge trees — `proposals/` (incl. `archive/`), `skills-user/`,
`skills-hivemind/`, `references/` and `memory/` — are wiped and rebuilt wholesale on every run
(there is no per-case scoping for these; they are not case-owned data). The four `config/*.json`
files above are overwritten every run too (see the safety guard). Everything else already present
in `ARGUS_HOME` is left alone.

### Not covered

The `running` and `unstable` pull-request check-rollup states are not represented anywhere in the
seed. `running` exists only mid-workflow — a check that is actually in progress — so it can't be
captured as a static fixture; to see it live, re-run a job (`gh run rerun`) on pull request 6 and
open that case while the run is in flight. `unstable` is unreachable by this fixture: it needs a
non-required _failing_ check, which needs branch protection that `JiaweiHan88/HiveMindTest` does
not have. `unavailable` IS covered — `SYN-5-edge`'s pull request (999) does not exist, and the
app's own first-mount refresh writes a real `unavailable` status for it within a second of boot.

## findings-layout-fixture.mjs

Narrow fixture for `findings-layout-probe.mjs`, the committed CDP layout gate. Kept separate from
the seed above on purpose: the probe depends on its exact shape (worst-case severity/layer/badge
combinations at `FINDINGS_MIN_WIDTH`), so folding it into the broader seed would risk the gate
silently drifting whenever the broader seed's fixture data changes for unrelated reasons.

## library-layout-fixture.mjs / library-layout-probe.mjs

The same pattern for the Settings → Library rows. The fixture seeds one worst-case row — a
user-tier skill whose name is long and hyphenated and which also exists in the hivemind tier, so
it carries six chips next to the widest control cluster (Adopt upstream / Edit / Share / toggle).
The probe sweeps window widths down to the app's own `minWidth` (1280px) and asserts the skill
name never breaks mid-word and nothing overflows the row.

```bash
ARGUS_HOME=/path/to/home node scripts/library-layout-fixture.mjs
ARGUS_HOME=/path/to/home npx electron-vite dev --remoteDebuggingPort=9237
node scripts/library-layout-probe.mjs
```

Before the fix this gate guards, that row squeezed the name to 44px and broke it across four
lines (`triage-` / `a-` / `flaky-` / `test`) while the label line still overflowed by 170px.

**Pick a debugging port nothing else holds.** Every worktree's dev instance can be running at
once, and `/json/list` will happily hand you a _different_ checkout's window on a port already
taken — the probe preflights the renderer over IPC for the fixture skill and refuses to click
anything if it is not there, but the port collision is silent up to that point.

## cdp-routines-tray.mjs

Routines increment 4's live gate (spec `2026-08-08-routines-increment-4-design.md` §7.2). A tray
icon, its menu and an OS notification live outside the page, so CDP cannot see any of them — this
proves the mechanism instead: the keep-alive toggle round-trips into `config/settings.json`,
closing the main window with it ON leaves the process running, a routine on a schedule fires with
no window open (a `routine_runs` row appears, read straight from `argus.db`), and reopening a
window shows that run in Home's inbox. The tray icon's pixels, its menu labels, both
notifications, and the single-instance lock on a packaged build are the exit check's job, not
this script's — see `argus-docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-08-routines-increment-4-exit-check.md`.

```bash
ARGUS_HOME=/tmp/argus-inc4-gate npx electron-vite dev --remoteDebuggingPort 9228
ARGUS_HOME=/tmp/argus-inc4-gate node scripts/cdp-routines-tray.mjs
```

**Needs a human partway through.** Once the only window closes, there is no page target left for
`Runtime.evaluate` to run inside — nothing can click the tray icon from a script, which is the
whole point of the surface split this gate encodes. It waits (polling the debug port, up to 10
minutes) for a window to reappear and prints an instruction to click "Open Argus" from the tray
when it is time. The wait for the schedule itself to fire is up to 8 minutes — `MIN_INTERVAL_MINUTES`
(`shared/routines.ts`) floors interval schedules at 5, so this is genuinely a several-minute gate,
not a quick one.

Resolves the app's PID by asking the OS which process owns `CDP_PORT`'s listening socket (same
technique as `cdp-diagnostics.mjs`), rather than trusting a human-read PID off the terminal —
`electron-vite` spawning Electron through a wrapper process makes the terminal's own PID
unreliable for this.

## make-tray-icons.mjs

Regenerates `resources/trayTemplate.png`, `trayTemplate@2x.png` and `trayIcon.png` for the system
tray. Pure Node (no image dependency): it draws the Argus mark procedurally and PNG-encodes it
with `node:zlib`. Run it only when the mark changes — the outputs are committed.
