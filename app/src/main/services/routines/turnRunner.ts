 * Binds a `RoutinesService.runTurn`: resolve the driver, assemble the session-shape deps an
 * interactive session would get, then run one unattended background turn.
 *
 * DRIVER-KIND MISMATCH IS FATAL. `getDriverByKind` returns the Claude driver for ANY
 * unregistered kind, and `driverKind` has already been written into the session row by the
 * time we get here (service.ts). So a hand-edited `config/routines.json` with a typo'd
 * `"coplilot"` would record `coplilot` on the row, show `coplilot` on the UI chip, and then
 * execute on Claude — with a Copilot model slug if `model` is set. The old behaviour was a
 * `console.warn` into a terminal no user ever sees; throwing instead routes the truth through
 * `RoutinesService.execute`'s try/catch, which records it as a `failed` run whose `error` the
 * run-history UI already renders.
 *
 * SKILLS AND ACCESS, BUT NOT PERSONA. `assembleMode` is called for its skill half only —
 * `enabledSkills` (the driver allowlist) and `skillIndex` (how the model learns those skills
 * exist; without it, passing the allowlist accomplishes nothing). Its persona half is
 * discarded, and `packFragments` is empty, because a persona for assisting a human in defect
 * triage is not a persona for unattended automation: inheriting the interactive one would be
 * wrong rather than merely incomplete. The automation-side identity comes from the unattended
 * preamble `RoutinesService` prepends to the prompt. `contributeBack` is `false` for the same
 * reason — it only ever adds a persona nudge, which is discarded here anyway.
