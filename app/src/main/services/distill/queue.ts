/**
 * Single in-flight FIFO runner over the `distill_jobs` table.
 *
 * `kick()` fires a void async loop that processes queued jobs one at a time in id
 * order; every state transition (running/done/failed/cancelled) is persisted then
 * broadcast. `idle()` is a test helper only — it must consult BOTH the `running`
 * flag and `nextQueued()` because `nextQueued()`'s `WHERE state='queued'` clause
 * excludes a job that is currently mid-flight (state='running'); checking the DB
 * alone would report "idle" while a job is actively running. Every `running`/DB-state
 * read used by `idle()` happens on the same synchronous call stack as the code that
 * mutates it (enqueue/retry set `running=true` synchronously inside `kick()`, before
 * any `await`; the loop's terminal `nextQueued()` check and the `finally` block's
 * `running=false` + waiter resolution run back-to-back with no intervening `await`),
 * so there is no window where external synchronous code could observe a torn state
 * — Node's single-threaded, run-to-completion execution combined with the
 * synchronous `node:sqlite` driver rules that out.
 *
 * `cancel()` is a third external synchronous mutator, called from an IPC handler
 * rather than from `kick()`, but it preserves the same invariant rather than
 * breaking it. On both a queued and a running job it does a single synchronous DB
 * write (state→'cancelled', finished_at→now) and emits, before returning; it never
 * touches the `running` flag either way — for a queued job, `nextQueued()`'s
 * `WHERE state='queued'` simply stops matching that row, same as if `kick()` had
 * consumed it; for a running job, `running` stays true until the loop's own
 * `finally` clears it once `runJob` actually returns. Only after that DB write and
 * emit does the running branch call `AbortController.abort()` — which synchronously
 * dispatches every listener registered on that signal, still on `cancel()`'s own
 * stack. Today the only such listener (`abortRacer` in `agent/driver.ts`) just
 * rejects a promise; it does not read or write `running` or the job row, so it
 * introduces no further synchronous state change here — but that is a fact about
 * today's listener, not a guarantee `abort()` itself makes. `runJob`'s own
 * aborted-path rewrite of the same terminal row (in its success-path guard and its
 * `catch`) runs later, on a separate turn once the driver's promise actually
 * settles, and is written to be a no-op over what `cancel()` already persisted.
 * Because `cancel()` never partially mutates state across an `await`, there is
 * still no window where a concurrent synchronous read (from `idle()` or `kick()`'s
 * loop) can observe torn state.
