/**
 * The one rule for "how should this session's review turn be framed" — shared by CaseSession
 * (session.ts's `subagentsForSession`, which decides which layer agents actually get
 * registered on the driver) and the review-run composer (`reviewRunCompose.ts`'s
 * `resolveReviewFraming` below, which decides which framing text the composed turn uses), so
 * the two answer the question through the identical resolution path for the same session
 * instead of each maintaining its own copy of the rule.
 *
 * Before this helper existed they didn't just risk disagreeing — they disagreed by
 * construction. The composer read capability off `sessions.instance_id` alone (ignoring mode
 * entirely) and defaulted to 'promptable' the moment `instance_id` was null — a documented
 * steady state for an unpinned session, not a corrupt row. session.ts's own invariant is mode
 * AND driver support together. So an unpinned session actually running the Claude driver in
 * review mode had the four layer agents genuinely registered (session.ts asked the real
 * resolved driver) while the composed turn ALSO inlined every layer body with its
 * delegate-only "you have no findings tool" contract (the composer asked a static table keyed
 * on a null id) — both framings landing in the same turn.
 *
 * Agents are only ever registered when mode === 'review' AND the driver can host named
 * subagents (session.ts:147-153's invariant) — either half missing means the turn must be
 * framed 'promptable', even on a driver that itself supports 'configurable' in other modes.
