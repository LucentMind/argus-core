   * SESSION-SHAPE DEPS — the ones an interactive session gets from AgentService.getOrCreate
   * (registry.ts) and a background session must get too. They are INJECTED rather than derived
   * here because their live sources (the agent-access store, the tool-risk store, the pack
   * registry) are host-owned; `routines/turnRunner.ts` is what binds them in production.
   *
   * Each one is absent-safe so existing tests keep constructing a bare deps object, but leaving
   * any of them out in production is a real behaviour difference, not a missing nicety:
   *  - no `enabledSkills`  -> `session.ts` passes `skills: []`, so the run has NO Argus skills;
   *  - no `skillIndex`     -> the skills are loadable but never advertised, which defeats
   *                           passing `enabledSkills` at all;
   *  - no `agentAccess`    -> `session.ts` falls back to `defaultAgentAccess()`, which INJECTS
   *                           memory topics the user explicitly disabled on the Knowledge page.
   *                           That is a user-facing privacy control, so this one is the reason
   *                           the whole group exists;
   *  - no `toolRisk`       -> the user's connector-tool risk overrides are ignored. INERT today
   *                           and passed for correctness only: risk.ts consults `toolRisk` on
   *                           the generic `mcp__<server>__<tool>` branch alone, which sits below
   *                           the hardcoded native-tool table, and a background session
   *                           registers no connector servers at all;
   *  - no `packCliNames`   -> pack analysis CLIs lose their LOW-risk allowlist (`risk.ts`).
   *                           NARROWER than it sounds, and verified rather than assumed: an
   *                           unrecognized bash program already defaults to allow/LOW, so this
   *                           only decides anything for a pack CLI whose name collides with the
   *                           raw-text-tool list (grep/rg/cat/…) on an `evidence/` path — which
   *                           is MEDIUM-ask, and every ask is DENIED under `unattended`.
   *  - no `defectCorpus`   -> `search_known_defects` takes its `no-sources` fallback branch and
   *                           returns "no sources configured" — a plausible STRING, not an
   *                           error. A routine that asks whether a defect has been seen before
   *                           is told no, confidently, and continues. This was live in
   *                           increments 1-4.
   *
   * DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: `personaFragments` / `personaFragmentIds`. A persona written to help
   * a human triage a defect and a persona for unattended automation are different things, so
   * inheriting the interactive one would be wrong rather than merely incomplete. The
   * automation-side identity is supplied by the unattended preamble `RoutinesService` prepends
   * to the prompt; a purpose-built automation persona is future work.

 *
 * TRUST BOUNDARY (structural, not advisory):
 *  - `unattended: true` — every ask-level verdict denies at BOTH seams and AskUserQuestion
 *    auto-dismisses (session.ts). This is also what makes the turn unable to hang:
 *    PendingApprovals/PendingDialogs have no timeout, so an ask with no renderer to answer it
 *    would block forever.
 *  - NO `extraMcpServers` — omitting the field entirely is the containment that keeps
 *    connector write tools (Jira/GitHub) from ever being registered in a background session.
 *  - NO `permissionMode` — `bypassPermissions` and `acceptEdits` let some driver skip both
 *    deny seams. session.ts downgrades them under unattended, but this never sets one at all
 *    rather than relying on that.
 *
 * RESOLUTION MODEL — one latch, one teardown, one resolve:
 *  `outcome` is a write-once latch. The first caller of `settle()` decides the result and is
 *  the only one that triggers teardown; every later event — including the `session.exited`
 *  that `stop()` itself emits, a late `turn.completed`, or a second error — re-enters
 *  `settle()`, sees the latch, and is ignored. So the timeout path cannot be overwritten by
 *  its own teardown, and `resolve` runs exactly once. Teardown is unconditional: `stop()`
 *  runs on every path (success, failure, timeout, a synchronous `send()` throw) so the mirror
 *  flushes and no session leaks, and the promise resolves whether it settles or rejects — a
 *  teardown failure must not strand the caller.
 *
 *  CONSTRUCTION IS INSIDE THAT MODEL TOO. `new CaseSession(...)` does real work
 *  (`touchSession`, `caseDir`, `driver.createSession`), so it can throw. That throw is caught
 *  and reported as a resolved `{ status: 'failed' }` — the SAME channel as a synchronous
 *  `send()` throw — because this function's signature is `Promise<BackgroundTurnResult>` and a
 *  synchronous throw out of it is invisible to a caller holding `.catch()` on the returned
 *  promise. `settle()` is the only teardown site and skips `stop()` when `session` is still
 *  undefined: nothing was constructed, so there is nothing to tear down.
