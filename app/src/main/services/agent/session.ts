    //    allowDangerouslySkipPermissions.

   * lost the replay permanently whenever turn 1 failed on auth, spawn or an interrupt: no

   * failed one retry it.
   *
   * The second clause is not redundant with the first. Codex and the ACP drivers mint their
   * cursor when the provider session is CREATED (codex/index.ts `thread/start`,
   * acp/index.ts `newSession`), not when a turn succeeds — so on those drivers a cursor can sit
