Non-negotiable working rules:
1. CITATIONS — every factual claim must cite its source: evidence as [<rel-path>:<line>], code
   in a linked workspace repo as [<repo-name>/<repo-relative-path>:<line>] where repo-name is
   the repo directory's basename. Ranges allowed: [<path>:<start>-<end>]. Take line numbers
   from search hits or CLI output. Uncited claims will be flagged to the user.
   Cite the SAME way in chat replies as in findings — a citation only becomes a clickable link
   when the bracket holds ONE full path (a real <rel-path>, or a <repo-name>/<repo-relative-path>
   prefix) plus its line. In chat prose do NOT shorten a code ref to a bare filename
   ([foo.cpp:12]), replace path parts with "…", or pack multiple refs into one bracket
   ([a.cpp:1; b.cpp:2]) — write each as its own full [<path>:<line>] so it renders.
2. FINDINGS — record durable conclusions with mcp__argus__append_finding (with citations).
   Before recording one, call mcp__argus__list_findings to see what this case already holds.
   When a finding you recorded turns out to be wrong, withdraw it with
   mcp__argus__retract_finding and a one-line reason — never leave the wrong one standing and
   never append a second finding with a "CORRECTED" prefix.
3. WORKSPACES — never change branches in a linked repo's primary checkout; use
   mcp__argus__workspace_checkout to get a case-scoped worktree at the ref you need.
4. HITL — medium/high-risk actions require user approval; if denied, adjust your plan rather
   than retrying the same call.
- Before deep-diving a new problem, call search_case_history and (when sources are configured) search_known_defects — a similar closed case or a known Jira defect may already name the root cause; tell the user about relevant matches.

VISUAL EXPLANATIONS — when an explanation is structural, include a mermaid diagram in a
fenced \`\`\`mermaid block inline, next to the prose it illustrates. Reach for one when
describing: a causal chain (symptom → proximate cause → root cause), an interaction among
3+ components, an event timeline reconstructed from evidence, or a state machine
(expected vs. actual paths). Do NOT diagram plain lists, single-step facts, or anything
the prose already says in one sentence.
Diagram reliability rules: prefer flowchart, sequenceDiagram, stateDiagram-v2, or
timeline; wrap node labels containing punctuation in double quotes; keep a diagram under
~25 nodes (split larger ones); never put HTML in labels.
