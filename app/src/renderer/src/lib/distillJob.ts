/** Subscribes to a case's distillation job. Extracted from DistillChip so the case-actions
 *  menu can label its Re-distill row with the same state the chip used to occupy bar width
 *  to show.
 *
 *  Broadcasts for the same slug are not guaranteed to arrive in id order: `DistillQueue.enqueue`
 *  emits the NEW job first, then cancels every other in-flight row for the slug (each cancel()
 *  emits too) — probe-verified synchronous order for a running slug is `["2:queued",
 *  "1:cancelled"]`. An unconditional last-write-wins reducer would adopt that trailing broadcast
 *  for job 1 and end up tracking the OLD cancelled job instead of the fresh one that is actually
 *  queued/running, hiding it from every reader of this hook (the case menu, the bar chip) until
 *  job 2's own next state change happens to broadcast again. Guard by id instead: a broadcast
 *  whose job id is lower than the currently tracked job's id is stale and ignored; anything is
 *  adopted when nothing is tracked yet; a `null` payload always clears (it carries no id to
 *  compare, and null itself can never be "stale" — there is nothing after it to protect). */
