/**
 * The two anchor slots the dynamic theme steers by, plus the ref callbacks that fill them.
 *
 * WHY CLAIM/RELEASE AND NOT TWO `useState` SETTERS (regression fixed 2026-08-02): several
 * unrelated components write these two slots — the active view (home's filter row, the case
 * band) and `TopBar` (Settings' title and the header itself). They do not mount and unmount in
 * the same React commit, because `TopBar`'s anchors are gated on `viewTitleStore`, which
 * `SettingsView` clears from an unmount effect in the PASSIVE phase — one commit after the
 * destination view has already rendered and attached its own anchors.
 *
 * So leaving Settings produced this order: home attaches its `h1` and filter row (commit A), then
 * `TopBar` re-renders without a settings bar and React detaches the header's stale ref (commit B).
 * With bare setters that trailing detach wrote `null` over anchors that belonged to home, and the
 * canvas silently fell back to its hard-coded 460px cutoff — a full-height aurora on every view
 * reached from Settings. Nothing about the wiring looked wrong; only the commit order was.
 *
 * The guard makes the slot order-independent instead of merely ordered-correctly-today: a writer
 * can only ever remove its own node, so a late release from a departing component is a no-op once
 * someone else has claimed the slot, and a same-commit swap (mutation-phase detach before
 * layout-phase attach) still works because the outgoing node IS what the slot holds at that point.
