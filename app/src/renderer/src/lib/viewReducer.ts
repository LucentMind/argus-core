/**
 * Pure view-transition logic shared by the Settings, Observability,
 * Related History and Proposals toolbar icons (App.tsx's
 * `openSettings`/`openObservability`/`openRelatedHistory`/`openProposalsView`).
 * Extracted from App so the toggle rules -- including the branch below with
 * no DOM path -- have an honest, directly-testable seam.
 *
 * Toggle rules:
 *  - Observability: a click while already on Observability returns to
 *    `prevView` (toggles shut). Otherwise switches to Observability.
 *  - Related History: same toggle rule as Observability -- a click while
 *    already on it returns to `prevView`; otherwise switches to it.
 *  - Settings: a click while already on Settings AND the action carries no
 *    `page` returns to `prevView` (toggles shut) -- this is what the toolbar
 *    gear does (it calls openSettings() with no page). But `openSettings` is
 *    also used to deep-link into a specific page (onboarding "rerun setup",
 *    etc.); when a `page` is given and the view is already Settings, this
 *    must switch pages instead of closing, or a deep link into an
 *    already-open Settings view would slam it shut instead of navigating.
 *    (SettingsView stays mounted across this transition -- App renders it
 *    unkeyed, and it syncs its visible page from the changed `initialPage`
 *    prop itself.)
 *  - Proposals: same toggle rule as Settings with the `page` carve-out copied
 *    for `types` -- a click while already on Proposals AND the action carries
 *    no `types` returns to `prevView` (toggles shut). But opening Proposals
 *    with a preset `types` while already open re-presets instead of closing
 *    (this is what the Library banner's deep link does).
 *
 * `prevView` bookkeeping (recording the view being left, and not overwriting
 * it when re-entering a view already active) stays the caller's job -- this
 * function only decides what the next `View` should be.
