          breadcrumb repeated the tab's own label, and these two buttons now render up in the
          window's title-bar strip. A PORTAL, not lifted state — everything they read stays owned
          here; only the DOM position moves. See paneActionSlot.ts.

          Gated on `active` because every tab stays mounted (spec §6.1) and all N panes share one
          slot: without it the strip would grow a Save button per open asset, in tab order. A null
          slot (no provider — this component's own tests, any future host) renders no actions at
          all rather than dropping them somewhere nobody designed.

          Enablement and action come from the command DESCRIPTORS, not from local expressions
          (spec §6.4). That is what keeps a button and its keyboard shortcut from disagreeing, and
          it is the whole point of the registry — moving these two into the title strip changed
          where they render, not where they get their truth from. `cmdFor` falls back to local
          expressions only when no host supplied a list, which is a test path; see its comment. */}
