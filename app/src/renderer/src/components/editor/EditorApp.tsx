 *
 * This is not about `setTabDirty`/`patch` returning a new `TabsState` object — making `patch`
 * identity-preserving still OOMs on the very first keystroke, and one tab is enough to trigger
 * it. The real driver is `AssetPane`'s **identity-keyed unmount cleanup**
 * (`useEffect(() => () => onDirtyChange(false), [onDirtyChange])`) alongside its **dirty-report
 * effect** (`useEffect(() => onDirtyChange(dirty), [dirty, onDirtyChange])`) — cited by name
 * rather than by line, because the line numbers drifted twice and were stale inside the very
 * commit that wrote them. A `.map`-inline `(d) => onDirtyChange(t.id, d)` is a new function on
 * every `EditorApp` render, and on every such change React runs the cleanup (writing `false`) and
 * then the report setup (writing `true`) — two genuine `dirty` transitions per render, each
 * triggering another `EditorApp` render, which mints another new callback. No amount of memoizing
 * `patch` absorbs that; only a stable `onDirtyChange` identity does. Binding `tab.id` inside this
 * component via `useCallback` is what supplies that stability, so neither effect re-fires except
 * when `dirty` itself actually flips.
 *
 * **`memo` on top of that** (not instead of it). Every cursor move calls `onViewStateChange` →
 * `setTabView` → a new `TabsState` → an `EditorApp` re-render, which without this re-renders
 * EVERY mounted pane. `viewMode` is a global pref, so once the user picks Split or Preview there
 * is a `PreviewPane` mounted in all N tabs and react-markdown re-parses every hidden tab's
 * document on every keystroke. A bare `memo` is correct and complete here because both of its
 * preconditions hold: `patch` (tabs.ts) preserves the object identity of every tab it did not
 * touch, and all seven callbacks below arrive from `useCallback`s in `EditorApp` that never
 * re-create (`onEditCopy` moves only when a tier list is re-broadcast). Do not "simplify" either
 * of those into an inline arrow. The two newest — `onCommandState` and `registerPane` — get the
 * exact same treatment for the exact same reason: an inline `.map` arrow for either would be a
 * fresh identity every render, and `registerPane` in particular is a callback REF, so a fresh
 * identity every render would call it with `null` then a new handle on every single keystroke
 * anywhere in the window.

   *
   * The two flows are asymmetric on purpose: a skill FORK creates a new name, so it needs the
   * name-entry dialog and its inline collision retry (`forkSkill` throws on a taken name); a
   * reference CLAIM keeps the same name and only changes the tier, so a plain confirm suffices.
   * Both still finish through `replaceTab`, which re-derives `readOnly` for the new pane (see
   * tabs.ts).
   *
   * **Both flows report a rejected IPC.** The fork's goes to `ForkSkillDialog`, which is still on
   * screen and can offer another name; the claim has no dialog left by then, so it goes to the
   * app-wide `alert()` (lib/confirmStore) — the same convention `ObservabilitySettings` and
   * `connectorForm` use for an IPC that rejects out of an event handler. Nothing here may be left
   * as a bare unhandled rejection: this used to sit in a `catch`-less `void (async () => …)()`,
   * and a claim that main refused looked exactly like a button that did nothing.
