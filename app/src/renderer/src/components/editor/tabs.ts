/**
 * A create-mode tab whose save has landed. From here on it is a tab over a file that exists.
 *
 * Nothing else flips `mode`, and leaving it at `'create'` after a save is two bugs at once:
 *
 * 1. `sameAsset` includes `mode`, so clicking *Edit* on the just-created asset in the Library
 *    mints a SECOND tab over the same file. Both stay mounted, and `draftKey` is `kind:name`
 *    only (main/services/drafts.ts) — so the two share one draft file and stomp each other, and
 *    a save from one leaves the other with a stale `baseHash` and a conflict banner describing
 *    nothing.
 * 2. The persisted set carries `mode: 'create'`, so a restart replays create mode over a file
 *    that now holds real content: `AssetTab` resolves disk into a create-mode `AssetPane` whose
 *    `lastSaved` is `null` again. That is exactly the state `AssetPane.renameCreate`'s
 *    `lastSaved === null` guard exists to prevent — one keystroke in the name field replaces the
 *    saved body with boilerplate and files that boilerplate as the draft.
 *
 * **`req` deliberately does NOT flip with it.** `AssetTab` resolves disk and the draft off `req`,
 * and its resolve effect keys on `req`'s kind/name/mode. Moving `req` here would re-run that
 * resolve underneath a LIVE CodeMirror that already owns the document — re-reading disk and
 * re-resolving the draft, so the save-then-keep-typing path would raise a "Restored unsaved
 * draft" banner over a buffer the user is still in, and the pane's `mode` prop would swap the
 * name field out from under them mid-edit. That is precisely what `req`'s frozen contract exists
 * to stop (see the note on {@link Tab.req}). `mode` on the tab is a different fact from
 * `req.mode`: the first is what the tab holds *now* (dedupe + persistence), the second is the
 * request that mounted the pane and stays true for that pane's whole life. The next window gets
 * the corrected mode because the report reads `t.mode`.
 *
 * `name` is a parameter rather than read off the tab so this is correct however it is ordered
 * against `renameTab`: a create-mode save adopts the name the write actually used.

/**
 * *Edit a copy*: the tab keeps its slot but becomes a different asset.
 *
 * A **fresh id** on purpose (deviation 1). The replacement re-resolves the asset from disk under
 * a new `AssetTab`, and the old view state goes with it: a different file wants a different
 * cursor.
 *
 * The remount is **not** what makes the new pane editable, though it reads that way. `readOnly`
 * is re-derived from the tier maps, and after a claim those can still be pre-claim — so the
 * replacement pane can mount read-only. `CodeSurface` reconfigures `readOnly` through a
 * compartment when the `refsync:changed` / `skills:changed` broadcast lands, which is what
 * releases it; without that this depended on main happening to broadcast before the claim IPC
 * returned.
 *
 * Spec §6.1's "one tab per asset" binds here too, and it is not `openTab`'s business alone: fork
 * a read-only skill onto a name that is ALREADY open in another tab and minting would give two
 * tabs over one file — the same shared-draft-key and stale-`baseHash` damage as a duplicated
 * create-mode tab (see {@link markTabSaved}). The persisted set would carry the duplicate too,
 * and restore folds it back through `openTab`, so the tab COUNT would change across a restart.
 * So a replacement that matches an open tab **folds into it**: the replaced slot closes and the
 * tab that already holds the asset becomes active.
