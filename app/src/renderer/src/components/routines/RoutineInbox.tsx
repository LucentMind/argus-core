 * the work and failed to deliver it. This section sits above the case grid and disappears
 * completely when there is nothing to review, so a user with no routines never sees it.
 *
 * It renders the runs the payload carries (capped at 50 by listRoutineRuns) but prints
 * `unreviewedCount`, which is a SQL count over every row — so a backlog deeper than the window
 * reports honestly, and "Mark all reviewed" clears all of it.
