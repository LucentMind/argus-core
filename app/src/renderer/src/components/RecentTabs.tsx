/**
 * The recently-opened cases: the tab band inside TopBar's right group, which is what bounds it
 * — the group is capped at half the bar and the action icons inside it never shrink, so this
 * band gets exactly "whatever is left between the bar's mid-point and the icons" and the icons
 * are visible at every window width (user-directed, 2026-08-02).
 *
 * This component therefore owns no margin of its own. An earlier version placed the band with
 * `ml-[50%]`, which is the bug that made the icons leave the window: a percentage margin is not
 * flexible, so when the case group plus that margin exceeded the bar the overflow had nowhere
 * to go and pushed everything after it off the right edge. Bounding is the parent's job; this
 * one only has to shrink to nothing (`min-w-0`) when asked.
 *
 * The right-alignment is an `ml-auto` on the inner row, NOT `justify-end` on the scroller. An
 * auto margin collapses to zero once the content overflows, so the list simply starts scrolling
 * from its left edge; `justify-end` instead keeps pushing, and the overflow spills past the
 * container's start edge where scrolling cannot reach it. Shift+wheel scrolls it natively — an
 * `overflow-x` container needs no handler.
 *
 * The active case is deliberately absent: it lives in the bar's case anchor, and showing it in
 * both places is the duplication this layout exists to remove.
 *
 * `argus-nodrag` is what makes any of it clickable — and scrollable: the OS drag handler
 * swallows the wheel gesture over a drag region too.
