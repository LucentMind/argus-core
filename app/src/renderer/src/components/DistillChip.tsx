  // share this one guard rather than each getting its own: the cancel handler reads `job.id`
  // from `override ?? tracked`, so an unguarded stale retry response adopted over a newer job's
  // row would make the chip's ✕ cancel the wrong job id, and the resulting `cancelled` override
  // would match no render branch, hiding a genuinely running chip. `react-hooks/refs` forbids
  // touching a ref's `.current` directly in the render body (the block above), so this lives in
  // an effect instead. The guard logic is unconditional, but winning the race relies on the
  // broadcast IPC arriving as a separate task whose microtasks drain before the
  // `cancel()`/`retry()` `.then()` handler — an assumption about Electron's IPC scheduling, not
  // a documented contract. If that breaks, the stale row is adopted, matches no render branch,
  // and the chip vanishes until the next broadcast — transient cosmetic gap only. Not the
  // mount/unmount `ref.current = false` cleanup that breaks under StrictMode — fires on every
  // commit where `tracked` changed, mirroring the render-time reset, and repeated bumps are
  // harmless since callers check `===` against a snapshot, never the count. (Tests in `act()`
  // prove guard logic but not the timing assumption.)

    // depending on the main-process broadcast, which `DistillQueue.emit()` swallows failures
    // from. `cancel()` persists the terminal `cancelled` state synchronously before returning,
    // so the resolved row is correct to adopt directly via `setOverride` — but only if nothing
    // has superseded it since the click: if a broadcast for a newer job on this slug lands
    // first, the adjust-during-render block above already reset `override`/`cancelling` and
    // bumped `cancelEpochRef`, and adopting this now-stale `cancelled` row for the old job would
    // overwrite the newer job's row with one that matches no render branch, hiding its chip.

    // `Chip` renders a plain `<span>` without a handler, which would swap out the `<button>`
