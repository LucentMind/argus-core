 * An ordered scale as a slider — Claude Code's Effort control. Used instead of {@link Segmented}

 * (Reasoning runs Low → Max plus Ultracode); the current value is named once in the section
 * header instead, and the track carries only dots.
 *
 * Each stop is still a `role="menuitem"` button — named via `aria-label`, since the visible
 * content is a dot — so the same reading holds as for `Segmented`: role, accessible name and
 * the `text-ink`/`text-dim` selected state all survive the redesign.
 *
 * It is draggable as well as clickable. The two paths are deliberately separate rather than
 * unified through one hit-test:
 *
 *  - Click is the stop buttons' own `onClick`, untouched. It needs no geometry, so it keeps
 *    working in jsdom — where every `getBoundingClientRect()` is a zero-sized box and a
 *    position-from-x calculation would land on stop 0 no matter where the click was.
 *  - Drag runs off `pointermove` on `window` (started by a `pointerdown` anywhere on the
 *    track) and bails whenever the track measures zero-width, so it can never fire in that
 *    same jsdom case and fight the click.
 *
 * Pointer *capture* is avoided on purpose: capturing retargets the subsequent `click` to the
 * capturing element, which would swallow the stop buttons' own clicks. Window listeners give
 * the same "keep tracking past the edge" behaviour without touching click dispatch. A drag
 * that starts and ends on different stops fires its `click` at the wrapper (their common
 * ancestor), not at a button, so the two paths never both apply a value.

 * reporting all four descriptors plus Access and Tool results overflowed the row well before
 * any individual chip's label got long, so collapsing every descriptor into ONE chip — rather
 * than shortening each chip's own label — is what actually bought back width. See
 * `COLLAPSE_AT_PX` in Composer.tsx for the threshold this shape lets be much narrower than

 *
 * A select descriptor's value is used bare (`selectionLabel` alone) — its vocabulary is
 * self-describing (`High`, `Ultracode`, `200k`, `1M`, …), same reasoning `DescriptorChip` used
 * to keep those chips value-only. A BOOLEAN descriptor's value is prefixed with its own label
 * (`Fast Off`, `Thinking On`) rather than left bare: two boolean values sitting side by side in
 * one joined string are otherwise indistinguishable ("… · Off · On" — which is which?) in
 * exactly the way a bare "Off"/"On" chip used to be before `DescriptorChip` started naming the
 * toggle on its own trigger (see that fix's own history) — fusing the chips must not
 * reintroduce that ambiguity.
 *
 * Reuses `OptionSection` verbatim — the same component the narrow density's `CollapsedMenu`
 * renders per descriptor — so the wide chip's popup and the narrow collapsed menu can never
