/**
 * Freshness and health of the tracker link (Jira or GitHub), in one footer slot.
 *
 * The icon carries health and the text carries age, because a badge that only ever said "Synced"
 * carried neither. The word "synced" is deliberately absent from the badge text: the check glyph
 * already says it, and the failure state spends those characters on "failed" instead.
 *
 * The failed state is therefore wider than the clean one, on purpose. Nothing here bounds that
 * difference — it is affordable because the status indicator sits in the card's TOP row, leaving
 * the footer with room to spare at three-column width. The widest case (`failed 3d ago` beside
 * both metrics and a CI glyph) is on the live-verification checklist for exactly this reason.
