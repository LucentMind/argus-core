          `max-w-[50%]` is the "from the centre" half: the group can never start left of the
          bar's mid-point, so a long case list cannot reach across into the case group's
          territory. `ml-auto` is what keeps it flush right once it stops growing (a capped
          flex item leaves free space unclaimed; an auto margin absorbs it). `min-w-0` is the
          "icons are always visible" half: the group may shrink below its content, and since
          the action buttons inside it are each `shrink-0` and the tab band is `min-w-0`, the
          band is what gives — down to nothing — while the icons keep their width. (Which icons
          render, and how many, is conditional on `onProposals`/`onRelatedHistory` — don't
          hardcode a count here, it has already gone stale once as buttons were added and
          removed across chrome-consolidation commits.)

          What NOT to do here, because it was tried: putting the 50% on the tab band itself as
          `ml-[50%]`. A percentage margin is not flexible, so once the case group plus that
          margin exceeded the bar the excess had nowhere to go and shoved the action icons off
          the right edge of the window.

          All of that is about BOUNDING the band, so it applies only when there is a band. Without
          one the growth rules are actively wrong: `flex-1` still stretched the group to half the
          bar, and since the icons inside are `shrink-0` and nothing right-aligns them within it,
          they sat at the group's leading edge — stranded mid-bar, which is what shipped when the
          band became case-only. Content-sized plus `ml-auto` is what keeps them in the corner. */}
