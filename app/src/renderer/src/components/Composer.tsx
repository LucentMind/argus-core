 * width (650 against a ~760-790px worst case). Both of that design's failures were real and
 * visible: between the threshold and the worst case the row simply overflowed and pushed Send
 * out of frame, and below it the row hid controls it still had room for.
 *
 * The old comment justified the fixed threshold by noting that measuring overflow
 * (`scrollWidth > clientWidth`) oscillates, because collapsing changes the very width the
 * condition is read from. That is true of that measurement, and it is why this one is built
 * differently: **every collapsible item is always rendered and always measured**, either in the
 * row or — when it does not fit — inside a 0×0 clipped container that keeps it out of flow (see
 * the ghost row in the JSX). So an item's measured width never depends on whether it is
 * currently shown, the container's width never depends on the decision, and `k` is therefore a
 * pure function of (container width, item widths). Nothing it reads can change as a result of
 * what it decides, so there is no loop to oscillate.
 *
 * Items are dropped from the END of the display order (Tool results, then Access, then
 * Traits), which is why the visible set is always a prefix and chips never reorder as the pane
 * narrows. The `…` trigger charges its own width whenever anything is hidden — forgetting that
 * is the classic priority-navigation bug where the last item fits only until the button meant
 * to hold it appears.

          stay measurable the whole time it is hidden.

          Deliberately a SIBLING of the options row, not a child: it holds duplicates of real
          chips, so keeping it outside means "everything inside the row" is exactly "everything
          the user can actually see and click" — for tests, for the CDP scripts, and for
          anything else that queries the row.

          The 0×0 `overflow-hidden` wrapper is doing real work: it is out of flow AND clips its
          own content, so an over-wide ghost contributes nothing to any ancestor's scrollWidth
          (no phantom horizontal scrollbar). The inner `w-max` is what gives the ghosts their
          NATURAL width inside a zero-width parent — without it they would measure 0 and every
          hidden chip would look like it fits.

          `inert` keeps them out of tab order and the accessibility tree, so the duplicate
          triggers are unreachable rather than merely invisible.
