   * `PrCompanionSection`'s "Find PRs") funnel through this so neither has to remember the
   * guard on its own; a future third caller inherits it too just by calling this.
   *
   * `pr.list` is a genuine IPC round trip, not a microtask; opening the dialog first and
   * setting `currentBinding` only once it resolves would leave a real window where "Link
   * selected" is clickable (a default candidate already selected) while `currentBinding`
   * still reads `null` — `PrPickerDialog.confirm()` cannot tell "nothing bound" apart from

   * `currentBinding` at all before this — skip it on EVERY link, not just a timing window).
   * A failed lookup still opens the picker (degrading to "nothing bound" rather than
   * blocking it — the confirm is a safety net, not a gate the picker depends on to
   * function), it just does so no earlier than a successful one would.
   *
   * `CaseWorkspace` is never remounted on a slug change (`App.tsx` renders it with no
   * `key`), so a case switch started while this is in flight would otherwise land ITS
   * case-A result on the now-current case B when it resolves. `forSlug`/`currentSlugRef`
   * (same purpose as the `sessions.list` effect's `stale` flag above, expressed as a ref
   * because this starts from an event callback / a `.then` continuation rather than an
   * effect keyed on `[slug]`) drops it instead — and the `slug !== lastSlug` block above
   * clears an already-open dialog for the OLD case, which a guard on the not-yet-resolved
   * lookup alone can't reach.
   *
   * Returns its promise so a caller that wants "busy until the dialog is actually up" (like
   * `PrCompanionSection`'s `searching` flag, via `handlePrsFound`) can await it — otherwise a
   * second search could start (and later resolve) before the first one's dialog had opened,

                The toggle used to ride ReposSection's header (as `headerExtra`), which made its
                y a fact about the rail's *content*: a case with a Jira ticket pushed it down by
                the whole ticket card, and scrolling the rail took it off screen entirely — while
                its opposite number in the findings rail never moved. Here it is the rail's own
                first row, so it sits at a fixed y whatever the sections do, and FindingsPane's
                header row is built to the same `h-8` at the same `p-3` inset so the two line up
                exactly — `h-8`, not the original `h-6`, because this row now also has to match
                PanelTabStrip's own root height once the bar moved out of the centre card to
                become its chrome row too (see the `<main>` render below). Flush to the OUTER
                edge on both sides, i.e. mirrored: the icon then sits on the edge it collapses
                into, and stops reading as a Repos affordance.
                "Workspace", not "Evidence" (user-directed, 2026-08-02): the rail carries the
                ticket, the repos and the PR as well, and CaseFiles below already owns the word
                Evidence for the thing that actually is evidence.
                Measured against the renderer's real Tailwind CSS (commit 7acf952b, before this
                row was `h-8`): all four toggle positions (left/right x open/collapsed) landed at
                24.00px from rail top, spread 0.00px. Raising the chrome row to `h-8` moves that
                shared value to 28.00px — the invariant is that all four still agree, not the old
                number. */}

              {/* The rail itself no longer scrolls (CaseFiles below needs flex-1 to mean
                something), so this wrapper keeps these naturally-growing sections — an
                unbounded repo list, PR checks, similar-case hits — reachable on a short
                window or a case with a lot of any of them, instead of silently clipping
                against the rail's overflow-hidden.
                Deliberately NOT shrink-0: flex-shrink:0 would pin this box to its full
                content height, so it would never become shorter than its content and
                overflow-y-auto would never have anything to scroll — verified live over
                CDP (see task-6-report.md) that content past the rail's height was then
                clipped by the aside's overflow-hidden with no way to reach it. Leaving
                the default shrink lets this box get bounded by the available space, at
                which point overflow-y-auto genuinely scrolls; CaseFiles' own min-h-32
                flex-1 (below) gives the card a floor it can't be squeezed under (flex
                distributes negative space by scaled shrink factor, and a flex-basis:0%
                child would otherwise absorb none of it, i.e. get squeezed to 0), which
                is what forces this box to give up space first instead.
                max-h-[55%]: that floor alone is not enough. CaseFiles' flex-basis:0%
                means its hypothetical size is 0 and the min-h-32 clamp is the only
                thing keeping it on screen, so a tall upper box (a case with several
                related-history hits, or a long repo list) leaves evidence at exactly
                128px — header, search bar, about one row — and because CaseFiles sits
                OUTSIDE this scroller there is no way to scroll the rest back into
                view. Capping this box at 55% of the rail bounds it before evidence
                hits its floor: past the cap this box scrolls internally and CaseFiles
                keeps the remaining ~45%. It is a max, not a size, so a short rail
                (no ticket, one repo) still collapses to its content and hands the
                slack to evidence exactly as before. */}

                  `${slug}:${activeMode}` (unlike CaseFiles above): the same repos show in both
                  modes (only the unlink/graph affordances differ), so keying on mode would
                  discard a good fetch — and the `git status --porcelain` spawns behind it — on

                  comment): without it, this would stay a single long-lived instance across case
                  switches, and a failed fetch for the new case would leave the old case's
                  findings on screen under the new slug. The remount also resets the per-case
