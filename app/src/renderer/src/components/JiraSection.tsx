/**
 * The case's Jira ticket, as an always-open rail section built exactly like `ReposSection`'s
 * repo rows: a two-line box — the ticket's title over its sync line — that highlights on hover
 * and opens Jira, with refresh as an icon button beside it (user-directed, 2026-08-02).
 *
 * It used to be a fixed-width pill in the top bar whose face carried terse counts (`+3 · ↑`)
 * and whose every detail — the prose summary, the error text, "Open in Jira" — lived behind a
 * popover, because a bar control cannot grow without shoving the mode switcher sideways. In a
 * rail panel none of that holds: line 2 says what the pill's face could only abbreviate, the
 * title is the "Open in Jira" it used to hide, and the popover is gone rather than moved.
 *
 * What survives from the pill is the announce-then-decay behaviour: a refresh result holds
 * line 2 for a few seconds and then hands it back to the resting stamp, because the stamp is
 * what answers "should I re-sync" and a line stuck on a result can no longer answer it.
