 *
 * ⚠️ **PROVISIONAL — EXPECTED TO CHANGE.** This is adopted deliberately as a starting point,
 * not because it is known to be correct. t3code's table is hand-maintained and demonstrably
 * disagrees with Argus's own live measurements in both directions (see the divergence list
 * below). Revisit it whenever the CLI's model line-up moves, and prefer a fresh measurement
 * over this table wherever the two conflict.
 *
 * **This table may only NARROW what the model reports, never widen it.** Every entry is
 * intersected with real capability data (`supportsEffort`/`supportedEffortLevels`/
 * `supportsFastMode`), so porting one of t3code's false positives cannot make Argus offer a
 * control the wire then rejects. That rule is load-bearing — see the Opus 4.7 row.
 *
 * Where this table disagrees with what Argus measured, and what happens:
 *
 * - **Sonnet 4.6 loses `xhigh` (and with it Ultracode) — t3code is RIGHT.** Measured
 *   2026-08-03 via an ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL capture: `effort:'xhigh'` leaves the CLI as
 *   `output_config.effort = "high"` on this model alone; every other effort-capable model
 *   passes `xhigh` through unchanged. Ultracode is `xhigh` + `settings.ultracode`, so it was
 *   landing two levels below what the chip claimed. This is the defect that prompted the port.
 * - **Opus 4.7 and Sonnet 5 lose Ultracode — t3code is UNVERIFIED here.** Both pass `xhigh`
 *   through fine, so the effort half of Ultracode works on them. t3code withholds it anyway
 *   and we follow, for now.
 * - **Opus 4.8 and Opus 4.7 lose Context Window — t3code CONTRADICTS a measurement.**
 *   `drivers.ts` records the `[1m]` suffix succeeding on both. This port removes a control
 *   that demonstrably worked; it is the clearest candidate to revert on revisit.
 * - **Opus 4.7 keeps NO Fast Mode despite t3code granting it — the narrowing rule saves us.**
 *   Argus measured fast mode returning API 400 ("does not support the `speed` parameter") on
 *   this model, and `supportsFastMode` is false for it, so the intersection drops it. Porting
 *   t3code naively here would have shipped a button that errors.
 * - **Opus 5 has no t3code entry at all** — its table predates that model. That row is
 *   Argus-originated, shaped after Opus 4.8 (its nearest analogue) plus Context Window, which
 *   is measured to work and which the CLI's own `opus[1m]` alias makes unavoidable anyway.
 *
 * Keyed by Argus's undated wire slug; matching tolerates a `[1m]` suffix and the CLI's
 * `-YYYYMMDD` date segment (see {@link policyFor}). A model absent from this table falls back
 * to pure capability derivation, so a newly-released model is never silently stripped of its
 * options — it simply is not curated yet.
