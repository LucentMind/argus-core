/**
 * The ONE answer to "does this model string name this catalog row?".
 *
 * Why it has to be shared: the Claude CLI's runtime catalog keys its rows by ALIAS
 * (`default`, `opus[1m]`, `fable`, `sonnet`, `haiku`) and reports the wire slug separately as
 * `resolvedModel` (`claude-opus-5[1m]`, `claude-fable-5`, …) — there is no `claude-*` string
 * in any `value`. Argus, meanwhile, pins a session by WIRE SLUG (`sessions.model`, seeded
 * from the static `CLAUDE_MODELS` list in `drivers.ts`). Matching a pinned slug against
 * `value` alone therefore never hits.
 *
 * Before this module the renderer and the main process each implemented that match
 * independently, and they disagreed: `Composer.tsx` fell through to `models[0]` (so every
 * chat's model chip read "Default (recommended)" regardless of its real model), while
 * `drivers/claude/catalog.ts` resolved a different row — or none, in which case
 * `queryOptions.ts` built `ds = []` and dropped every run option off the wire while the
 * composer still offered the full option set. Both now call in here, so they cannot drift
 * apart again.

 * The catalog-INDEPENDENT identity of a row — what a stored preference (favourite, hidden,

 *
 * A row's `value` is whatever the CLI called it at the moment it was read: `opus[1m]` on
 * 2.1.220, something else on the next release, and nothing at all when the catalog cannot be
 * reached. Storing a preference under it produces a pref that only the catalog that minted it
 * can interpret — and `defaultModelRef`/`orderedVisibleModels` sort the STATIC list, which has
 * no aliases at all. A favourite starred as `opus[1m]` therefore mapped to no row there and was
 * dropped, silently seeding every new case with whatever model happened to sort first instead.
 *
 * The canonical form is the wire slug with BOTH version-dependent suffixes removed — `[1m]`
 * (added by `apiModelId`, see `bare`) and the CLI's `-YYYYMMDD` build date. That is exactly the
 * shape `CLAUDE_MODEL_SPECS` already uses, so a canonical pref names the same model in the
 * static list, in today's catalog, and in next month's. `modelMatches` accepts it against all
 * three — the round trip is pinned by a test.
 *
 * A row with no `resolvedModel` (the static/offline shape, and every custom model) is returned
 * untouched: its `value` is already the wire slug, and stripping `[1m]` there would conflate an
 * explicitly-added `claude-sonnet-5[1m]` custom model with the base one (see `resolvesToId`).
